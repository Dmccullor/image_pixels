Instructions for use:

* Place all the images you want to analyze in a folder called "images" (all lowercase) into the parent folder (the folder that contains "img.exe")
	-I have named this folder "image_pixels"

* Double click "img.exe"

* The output will be printed to the terminal and also written to "output.txt"

* If you want to save this output for later use, be sure to move it outside the folder and rename if you wish

* "output.txt" will be overwritten each time the command is run
	- if "output.txt" is not present it will be created
